# Overview
This repo will allow us to create bootable container based on a base image and target image that we will specify
while running the script

## How to run the script

`sh install.sh quay.io/rbrhssa/bchris registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest`

The above command will take two arguments , of which the first one will be the target image and second one is the base image.

### What is the Containerfile doing ?

It sets up an image based on a Fedora image, configures SSH with a specified 
public key, installs an HTTP server, sets up storage configurations, 
pulls the base image i.e  using Podman, lists images with Podman , and performs an OSTree container commit.
